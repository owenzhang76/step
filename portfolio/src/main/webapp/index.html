      <p class="desc"> Thanks for visiting my site! I'm currently a rising Junior at UC Berkeley
        and I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Public Policy! Throughout my experiences 
        in various hackathons, projects, and leadership experiences, I hope to create tangible change that
        is beneficial for some of the most marginalized communities in the world. </br> </br>
        This year, I'm honored to intern in the Student Training in Engineering Program and look forward to 
        learning about all of the development that the Geo Services Team makes in the upcoming weeks. </p>
